However, tools for visual collaboration, such as through drawing, are currently lacking, with many suffering from lag, dropped connections or devices not syncing together correctly. \\n We have created a resilient collaborative drawing app for iPadOS, using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), that aims to prevent failures as listed previously from becoming an issue.\\nOur app, which is optimised for iPads, is called Canvas. Canvas allows users to connect and draw at the same time. Changes are propagated in real time, so if a user becomes temporarily disconnected, on reconnection, the changes that they made during this period will sync up. Canvas offers features such as shape recognition and bluetooth network optimisation.\\nCRDTs are a class of abstract data types that allow their state to be distributed across devices, modified locally and then merged in a straight-forward manner, meaning that they guarantee eventual consistency. Therefore, Canvas is completely de-centralised, so does not rely on one of the nodes to always be connected. CRDTs are currently an open research area, so this project started as a proof of concept to show that they could be used in this context. \\nSince this was an iPadOS app, we created it in XCode, using Swift 5.","sources":[{"name":"fab fa-github","url":"https://github.com/mnckapilan/crdt-canvas"}]},{"name":"Burst My Bubble","hidden":false,"type":"Uni Project","tech":["React","Java","MongoDB"],"url":"burst-my-bubble","dates":"May 2019 - June 2019","short_desc":"An app to tackle the problem of confirmation bias in the current consumption of the news","long_desc":" The internet is a powerful tool for connecting people but it hasn\'t necessarily brought us closer together. Sites are removing their comments sections in droves, with news feeds full of think pieces about the state of debate online. One cause of this downturn in decency is how easy the internet makes it to disregard opposing arguments. Our own \'confirmation bias\' means we\'re more likely to reading something that challenges our beliefs and content delivery algorithms on the internet have a vested interest in showing us what we like. It\'s becoming increasingly easy to live in a bubble (see what we did there?).\\nThe goal of \'Burst My Bubble\' was to create a news feed with a difference; to encourage variety so people had a more broad consumption of the news. We use RSS feeds to aggregate articles from a wide variety of news feeds, and along with the user\'s reading history, we curate a diverse and confronting personalised news feed. Users can share their thoughts on articles, but instead of the traditional comments and replies format, can instead only write one opinion, which they\'re free to edit as their point of view matures.\\nBurst My Bubble was awarded second best project for the year.\\nWe wrote the frontend of the application using React, and used Python and Java for the backend.
